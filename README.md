# huffman-file-compressor
Huffman File Compressor is a C++ command-line tool that compresses text using Huffman Coding. It lets users input text, builds the Huffman Tree, and shows both original and compressed bit sizes. The program also displays Huffman codes and allows you to visualize the tree, making it ideal for learning or demonstrating file compression concepts.
